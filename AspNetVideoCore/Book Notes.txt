launchSettings.json - The Properties folder in the Solution Explorer contains a file called 
    launchSettings.json, which contains all the settings needed to launch the application. 
    It contains IIS settings, as well as project settings, such as environment variables and 
    the application URL.

.csproj file - One major change from ASP.NET Core 1.0 is that the project.json file no longer exists; 
    instead the installed NuGet packages are listed in the .csproj file. To open the .csproj file, you 
    simply right click on the project node in the Solution Explorer and select Edit AspNetVideoCore.csproj
    You can add NuGet packages by adding PackageReference nodes to the file .csproj, or by opening the NuGet Package Manager.

Microsoft.AspNetCore. - All that is installed when the project is created. It contains references to the most frequently used NuGet packages

Startup.cs :
    The Configure and ConfigureServices methods in the Startup class handle most of the application configuration. 
    * The ConfigureServices method is where you set up the services, such as MVC or register your own Dependency Injection (DI);
    * Configure method (aka MiddleWare). The HTTP processing pipeline that defines how the application responds to requests;

-------------- MIDDLEWARE SECTION ---------------------------
Middleware is a series of components executed in order. For example: 
    1) Logger will log information and pass the processing onto the next middleware component in the pipeline. 
    2) The next middleware component might be an authorizer that can look at access tokens or cookies 
	   to determine if the request will proceed (return error or redirect to login page)
    3) If the request is authorized, it will be passed to the next middleware component like a routing component.

IApplicationBuilder
The IApplicationBuilder interface injected into the Startup class’s Configure method is used when setting up the middleware pipeline

"Run" middleware  - means that it is the end of the pipeline. 
    (context)=> object passed into Run method sheds light on requests through Request object or e.g. print out string thr Response object

Most middleware components will be added by calling a method beginning with Use on the app object, such as app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage.


UseMvcWithDefaultRoute method is   built-in support for default routing for the HomeController

-------------- END OF MIDDLEWARE SECTION -----------------------

appsettings.json - Configuaration file and does not come by default and should created by adding json ASP.NET Configuration File template.
			   The file could be named anything, but appsettings is convention for this type of configuration file.
			   IMPORTANT!!! To read configuration information from the appsettings.json file, you have to add a constructor to the Startup class


Dependency Injection 
To use dependency injection -  That is, pass in the interface as a parameter to the method
    Take advantage of dependency injection to make data available in a constructor by using a service component.
    One big benefit of implementing a service is that its interface can be used to implement different components


IHostingEnvironment service - handles different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

When adding a service to the service collection, you can choose between several Add methods. Here’s a rundown of the most commonly used.
* Singleton -  creates a single instance that is used throughout the application. It creates the instance when the first dependency-injected object is created.
* Scoped  -   services are lifetime services, created once per request within the scope. It is equivalent to Singleton in the current scope. In other words, 
    the same instance is reused within the same HTTP request
* Transient -  services are created each time they are requested and won’t be reused. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services


HTTP 500 Error - This page isn’t working error  ->  Friendly error for the users

Controller -  is responsible for handling any HTTP requests that come to the application and build a Model which is sent to the Views
    * The decision to send the request to a controller action is determined by the URL.
    ATTENTION!  Controller is a C# class, and an action is a public method in a controller class.
	   ** parameter can be any value that can be represented as a string
	   ** e.g. URL contains /Home/Index/123  = /Home controller class/public action (method) /parameter
                                                     
View - is responsible for transforming that data into HTML.

Routing Types: 
    1) convention-based routing

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
	   {
	   routes.MapRoute(
	   name: "default",
	   template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });

    2) attribute routing (page.41)

    [Route("[controller]/[action]")]
	 public class HomeController
	   {
	   }

-------- ActionResult  / IActionResult ----------------

“ActionResult is an abstract parent class from which ViewResult class has been derived”.


1. ViewResult - Renders a specified / particular view to the response stream whereas ActionResult can return all 11 views --- APPEARS TO BE THE MOST USED. 

2. PartialViewResult - Renders a specified partial view to the response stream
3. EmptyResult - An empty response is returned
4. RedirectResult - Performs an HTTP redirection to a specified URL
5. RedirectToRouteResult - Performs an HTTP redirection to a URL that is determined by the routing engine, based on given route data
6. JsonResult - Serializes a given object to JSON format
7. JavaScriptResult - Returns a piece of JavaScript code that can be executed on the client
8. ContentResult - Writes content to the response stream without requiring a view
9. FileContentResult - Returns a file to the client
10. FileStreamResult - Returns a file to the client, which is provided by a Stream
11. FilePathResult - Returns a file to the client


we are passing a boolean flag whether it’s an HTML view or not and depending on the same, we are streaming different views.

public ActionResult DynamicView(bool IsHtmlView)
{
   if (IsHtmlView)
     return View(); // returns simple ViewResult
   else
     return Json(); // returns JsonResult view
}

IActionResult

IActionResult has more return types than ActionResult. For ex: If you want to return HttpNotFound you have to use IActionResult return type. 

IActionResult allows a wider range of return types, including any custom code that implements the IActionResult interface.
ActionResult is limited only to those classes which extend the ActionResult abstract class 
    (which you could also do with custom code, but using an interface allows 
	   for something like multiple inheritance, while extending a class does not).

    IActionResult return type returns many types of data, such as objects and views. 
  ATTENTION!  To gain access to IActionResult or derivations thereof, the controller class must inherit the Controller class.
	   Other classes like IActionResult that return data: 
		  * ContentResult - return simple content e.g. string. 
		  * ObjectType - used in Web API applications and return actual object like JSON script



The main advantage is that you can return error/status codes or redirects/resource urls.

For example:

public IActionResult Get(integer id) 
{
    var user = db.Users.Where(u => u.UserId = id).FirstOrDefault();

    if(user == null) 
    {
        // Returns HttpCode 404
        return NotFound();
    }

    // returns HttpCode 200
    return ObjectOk(user);
}


-------- End of ActionResult ----------------


Views
To render the view, a ViewResult is returned from the controller action using the View method
  
  public ViewResult Index()   --- ViewResult
        {
            var model = new Video { Id = 1, Title = "Shrek" };
            return View (model);  --- View method
        }

    ASP.NET will look for a view with the same name as the action that produced the result
	It will look in two places, both subfolders, to a folder called Views:
	   - the first is a folder with the same name as the controller class, 
	   - the second a folder named Shared

---------- End Views -----------------

List<Video>. Note that a List collection isn’t thread safe, and should be used with caution in web applications

Entity is a class used to define a database table.

---------------- VIEW MODEL ----------------

A view model is used to transport data from the controller to the view
A view model is never used to directly update the database. 
    To update the database the data from the view model is added to an entity model, which then in turn updates the database table.

 A view model can carrier data from various entities or data bases

--------------- @model vs @Model ------------
@model directive to access the model class 
    @Model to access the model object. you don’t add the @-sign when already inside Razor code, but you use it when in HTML.

@foreach (var video in Model)  ---- > Model is not preceeded with @
       {
	   <tr> 
	      <td>@video.Id</td> 
		  <td>@video.Title</td>
	   </tr>
    }
--------------- @model vs @Model ------------


HTTP GET & POST
The HTTP GET Create action method renders the Create view to the browser, 
    displaying the necessary controls to create a new video and to post the form to the server.


Adding the HTTP POST Create Action
A <form> element is used when a user should enter data in a view. 
There are a few steps that are performed when a user posts data. 
The first you already know: the user sends an HTTP request to the HTTP GET action in the controller, 
    which fetches the necessary data after which the view is rendered.

To handle the form’s post back to the server, an HTTP POST version of the action method is called with the form values.
The names of the form controls are matched against the model properties or parameters available in the action’s parameter list.
The POST action then uses that data to create, update, or delete data in the data source.



C# Anonymous Type:
Anonymous type, as the name suggests, is a type that doesn't have any name. 
C# allows you to create an object with the new keyword without defining its class. 
The implicitly typed variable- var is used to hold the reference of anonymous types.

myAnonymousType is an object of anonymous type created using the new keyword and object initializer syntax 

Example: Anonymous type
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var myAnonymousType = new { firstProperty = "First", 
                                secondProperty = 2, 
                                thirdProperty = true 
                              };
}

or

in ASP.NET as a return type  --- >  return RedirectToAction("Details", new { id = video.Id });



Data Annotations
Data annotations are attributes you add to properties in a model, to enforce rules about them.
You can specify that a field is required or must have a maximum number of characters. 
The text displayed in a label is normally the property name, but that can be overridden with the [Display] attribute.
[Required]
[MaxLength(80)]
Or
[Required, MaxLength(80)]


--> 5. Entity Framework

Add a data context class that inherits from the DbContext class. 
This class will be the con-text that you use to interact with the database.
To add a table to the database, the table’s entity class must be added as a DbSet property in the context class.

first migration - Add-Migration command.
database can be generated with the Update-Database command.

If you make any changes to the database, like adding or changing columns or tables,
    execute the Add-Migration and Update-Database commands again .

----> User Secrets

The setup for User Secrets has been incorporated into the new BuildWebHost method in the Program.cs file,
    which means that you no longer have to add any configuration for it in the Startup class.
You can use User Secrets to store sensitive data locally in a file called secrets.json,
    which is stored outside the solution (do not commit). 
Store the connection string to the database securely in the secrets.json file.
It also renders the appsettings.json obsolete for storing secret or sensitive data

----> AddDbContext 

AddDbContext method to be able to add the context to the services collection, 
the VideoDbContext must have a constructor with a DbContextOptions<VideoDbContext> parameter, 
which passes the parameter object to its base constructor.


--> RAZOR VIEWS

---->_Layout view. 
@RenderSection -  method can be used to render specific sections of HTML from the content view in the _Layout view.
@RenderBody - responsible for rendering the different content views the user navigates to, such as the Index and the Details views.
@ViewBag in the _Layout view is a dynamic object that you can use to send data from the server to the view.


Ctrl+E, D keyboard command to format the HTML.

_ViewStart.cshtml. 
This file is executed before any other views, but it has no HTML output. 
One purpose it has is to remove duplicate code from code blocks in the views, like the Layout declaration.
Instead of declaring the location of the _Layout view in each view, it can be placed inside the _ViewStart view.
You can assign null to the Layout property in a specific view to stop any layout view from being used with the view.

_ViewImports.cshtml
add using statements that will be used by all the views
 
----> Tag Helpers
@addTagHelper directive to the _ViewImports view, or in specific views where you want to use them.
The first parameter, the asterisk, specifies that all Tag Helpers in that namespace should be available. 
You can change this to a specific Tag Helper if you don’t want to import all helpers. 
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
